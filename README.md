Upgrad Bike Sharing Assignment ML66


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same. 
* [Technologies Used] Python
* [Conclusions]A linear regression model is built with required variables.

## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
i.	Bike rentals are more during Summer and fall compared to other seasons
ii.	The count of bike rentals increased from June till October complementing the season data
iii.	We can also see that clear skies contributed to more rentals compared to other weather situations
iv.	Bike rides also increased during the year 2019 assuming that popularity was gaining on the second year of service
v.	More bikes are rented during Wednesday’s and Saturday’s
vi.	We can also see that more bikes are rented during a non-working day
